## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Preserving the rich biodiversity of heritage sites is paramount for future generations. However, identifying and cataloging the myriad species within these sites can be a daunting task. Many visitors lack the knowledge to recognize the animals and plants they encounter, hindering their appreciation and understanding of the ecosystem's importance. Moreover, the lack of accessible tools for species identification diminishes opportunities for citizen science and engagement.
