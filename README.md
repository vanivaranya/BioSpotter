## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Preserving the rich biodiversity of heritage sites is paramount for future generations. However, identifying and cataloging the myriad species within these sites can be a daunting task. Many visitors lack the knowledge to recognize the animals and plants they encounter, hindering their appreciation and understanding of the ecosystem's importance. Moreover, the lack of accessible tools for species identification diminishes opportunities for citizen science and engagement.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION

Through seamless image uploads, our cutting-edge machine learning model accurately identifies and labels species captured in photos, providing instant  information.
Moreover, our platform fosters bioheritage - awareness by featuring a resource gallery enriched with curated content sourced from reputable platforms. 
Additionally, our discussion board cultivates a vibrant community where enthusiasts can share their wildlife encounters, fostering a culture of learning and collaboration.
